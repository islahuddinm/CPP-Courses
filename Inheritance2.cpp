/* we can copy object without having copy constructor you know.

Yes, in C++, you can indeed copy an object without explicitly defining a copy constructor.
However, there are important considerations to be aware of, particularly when dealing with
dynamically allocated memory or other resources.

What Happens When You Don't Define a Copy Constructor?
When you don't provide a custom copy constructor for a class, the C++ compiler generates
a default copy constructor for you. This default copy constructor performs a shallow copy of
the object's members.

Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy:

Shallow Copy:
The default copy constructor performs a bitwise copy of the object. This means it copies the values of
all the member variables from one object to another.
If your class contains pointers, the shallow copy will copy the pointer values (addresses), not
the actual data they point to.
As a result, both objects (the original and the copy) will point to the same memory location.

Deep Copy:
A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a new memory allocation for the copied data. 
This ensures that the original and the copied objects are completely independent of each other.
To achieve a deep copy, you must define a custom copy constructor that handles the copying of
the data pointed to by any pointers in the class. */
