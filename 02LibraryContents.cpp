#include <iostream>
/* "#include"(enclose). "<iostream>"(library) which allows to use library functions in
"<iostream>"(library). "std::cin"(input) and "std::cout"(output). analogy of library is imagine that
library is a storage which it provides tools so if we dont have tool we cant do works.



/////////////////////////////////////// library contents ///////////////////////////////////////

- data and class type =
  data types are specific and are used to hold one particular kind of data, while
  class types are more flexible and can be designed to hold multiple kinds of data or work with various types.
  
- data type = int(integer), float, double, char(character), bolean.
- keyword which used to create "custom data types" (class types) = class, struct, union, enum, typedef, template.
- class type = custom data types (we can name data type as we like), predefined class types
  "custom data types (we can name data type as we like)" = horse, yellow, car.
  "predefined class types" = std::string, std::vector, "std::numeric_limits"(template class type)

- library functions
- generators
- keywords
- manipulators
- operators
- type traits

/////////////////////////////////// so what are those things ///////////////////////////////////

- library functions = standalone or independent function that perform specific tasks or operations without
being associated with any other library functions and data structures.

- generators = a construct or function that produces a sequence of values or objects.

- keywords = reserved words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.

- manipulators = functions or objects that can modify the output behavior of standard stream objects.

- operators = symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

- type traits = a template class used to check if a given type is integral, meaning it's
a built-in integer type like int, long, short, char, etc at compile time.
