#include <iostream>
/* "#include"(enclose). "<iostream>"(library) which allows to use library functions in
"<iostream>"(library). "std::cin"(input) and "std::cout"(output). analogy of library is imagine that
library is a storage which it provides tools so if we dont have tool we cant do works.

/////////////////////////////////// so what are those things ///////////////////////////////////

- library functions = standalone or independent function that perform specific tasks or operations without
being associated with any other library functions and data structures.

- predefined classes = part of c++ element can have library functions specially designed to manipulate or
interact with data encapsulated or contained within class.

- generators = a construct or function that produces a sequence of values or objects.

- keywords = reserved words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.

- manipulators = functions or objects that can modify the output behavior of standard stream objects.

- operators = symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

- type traits = a template class used to query or introspect properties of types at compile time.
