//One Definiton Rule in C++

/*
the One Definition Rule (ODR) is a fundamental rule that ensures that a particular entity
(such as a variable, function, class, or template) is defined exactly once in the entire program.
The ODR helps to avoid multiple definitions of the same entity, which could lead to linker errors and
undefined behavior.

we can not also use same name global variable even though in another file.
