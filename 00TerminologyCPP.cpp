//header
#include <iostream>
//"#include"(enclose). "<iostream>"(library) which allows to use library functions in "<iostream>"(library). "std::cin"(input) and "std::cout"(output).
//analogy of library is imagine that library is a storage which it provides tools so if we dont have tool we cant do works.

//compiler will always start to read top project to below then start to working in main fuction (int main).

/*
- function = a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks.
- data types = int(integer), float, double, char(character), bolean. used to define the type of
data that a variable can store.
- keyword which used to create custom data types / class types = class, struct, union, enum, typedef, template.

- variable = symbolic name assigned to store data and value.
- statement = a complete line of code that performs a specific action or operation/ a line code that have ";".
- declaration = a statement describing an identifier, such as the name of a variable or a function.
- assignment = a statement in computer programming that is used to set a value in a variable.
- initialize = start to the assignment of an initial value.
- expression = a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that can be evaluated to
produce a result.

- "return 0" in the main function = a signal to indicate to the operating system that the program is
successfully. it is used when scripting or using tools that execute programs, it's common to
check the exit status. A return value of 0 allows for automated processes to quickly determine whether
the executed program succeeded or encountered problems.

- "return" in other functions = enable to return values to main function.

- "FunctionUserDefined.cpp"(cpp file) in CPP-COURSES folder. it explaind more function terminologys.
